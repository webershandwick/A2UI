# A2UI on Gemini Enterprise

This folder contains examples and scripts to develop and use A2UI agents on
**Google Cloud Gemini Enterprise**.

## Folder Structure

This directory is organized into two sub-folders depending the deployment
methods:

-   `cloud_run`: Contains scripts and configuration to deploy an agent to
    **Cloud Run**. This is suitable for building and deploying AI agents
    quickly, leveraging its speed and simplicity.

    -   Starts with `cloud_run/README.md`.

-   `agent_engine`: Contains code to deploy to **Vertex AI Agent Engine**. Agent
    Engine provides additional features like agent context management, agent
    evaluation, agent lifecycle management, model-based conversation quality
    monitoring, and model tuning with context data.

    -   Starts with `agent_engine/README.md`.

## Shared Resources

-   `agent.py`: Contains the JSON schema for A2UI messages, used for validation
    during development and at runtime.
-   `prompt_builder.py`: Provides prompts including Role, Workflow, and UI
    descriptions.
-   `agent_executor.py`: A base implementation of an A2A (Agent-to-Agent)
    executor that handles A2UI validation and response formatting.
-   `contact_data.json`: Fake contact data for demo.
-   `tools.py`: A simple tools to find contact data.
-   `examples`: Examples for A2UI messages.

## Registration in Gemini Enterprise

Regardless of the deployment method, agents must be registered with Gemini
Enterprise. This involves: 1. **Defining an A2A Agent Card**: Describing the
agent's skills, name, and capabilities (including the **A2UI extension**). 2.
**Configuring Authorization**: Setting up OAuth2 or other authentication
mechanisms to allow the agent to talk to secure services. This is optional for
Cloud Run deployment but **mandatory for Agent Engine deployment**.
