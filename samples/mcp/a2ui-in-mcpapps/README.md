# A2UI in MCP Apps Sample

This sample demonstrates a Model Context Protocol (MCP) Application Host that isolation-tests untrusted third-party Angular components via a secure double-iframe proxy pattern.

## Architecture

*   **`client/`**: The host container application (Angular). It hosts the outer safe iframe.
*   **`server/`**: The MCP Server (Python/uv) that provides the micro-app resources and tools.
*   **`server/apps/src/`**: The source source code for the server-hosted isolated micro-app.

## Communication Flow

    participant Server as MCP Server
    participant Host as Client Host Application
    participant Proxy as Sandbox Proxy
    participant App as MCP App (Sandbox)
    participant A2UI as A2UI Surface

    Note over Host: 1. Loaded from Hosting server
    Host->>Server: 2. Fetch MCP App resource
    Server-->>Host: Return MCP App resource
    Host->>Proxy: 3a. Load Sandbox Proxy
    Proxy->>App: 3b. Serve App in isolated iframe
    
    Note over App: 4. CTA triggers relay request
    App->>Proxy: Request tool call
    Proxy->>Host: Relay Request
    Host->>Server: Forward Tool Call
    Server-->>Host: 5. Respond with A2UI JSON payload
    Host->>Proxy: Relay payload
    Proxy->>App: 6. Hand down payload to MCP App
    
    App->>A2UI: 7. Renders A2UI Components
    Note over A2UI: Click on A2UI Button
    
    A2UI->>App: 8. A2UI Button triggers UserAction
    App->>Proxy: Forward UserAction event
    Proxy->>Host: Relay UserAction to Host
    Note over Host: 9. Map Action to Tool Call
    Host->>Server: Forward Tool Call
    Server-->>Host: 10. Respond with A2UI payload (datamodelupdate)
    Host->>Proxy: Relay payload
    Proxy->>App: 11. Pipe payload to MCP App
    App->>A2UI: Update rendering
```

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (runs the client and build scripts)
- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/) with `uv` (runs the MCP server)

---

## Build & Regeneration

This sample relies on some generated bundle artifacts. Some are committed for convenience, while others are ignored and must be built.

### 1. Build Client Sandbox Bridge
The sandboxed iframe needs its asset bundle. Run this in the `client/` directory:
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run build:sandbox
```
*(Generates `client/public/sandbox_iframe/sandbox.{js,html}`)*

### 2. Rebuild the Server Hosted App (Optional)
The server serves a bundled `app.html` artifact located in `server/apps/public/app.html`. If you modify the source code in `server/apps/src/`, you must regenerate this list:

Run this in the `server/apps/src/` directory:
```bash
cd server/apps/src
npm install
npm run build:all
```
*(Runs Angular compilation and triggers `node inline.js` to single-file inline it into `server/apps/public/app.html`)*

---

## Running the Sample

### 1. Start the MCP Server
Run this in the `server/` directory:
```bash
cd server
uv sync
uv run python server.py --transport sse --port 8000
```

### 2. Start the Host Client
Run this in the `client/` directory:
```bash
cd client
npm run start
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to view the running host.
