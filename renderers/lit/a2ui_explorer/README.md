# A2UI Local Gallery (Minimal v0.8)

This is a standalone, agentless web application designed to render the A2UI v0.8 minimal examples directly from static JSON files. It serves as a focused environment for testing renderer subset compatibility and protocol compliance.

## Prerequisites

Before running this gallery, you **must** build the shared A2UI renderers.

### 1. Build Shared Renderers

Navigate to the project root and run:

```bash
# Build Web Core
cd renderers/web_core
npm install
npm run build

# Build Lit Renderer
cd ../lit
npm install
npm run build
```

For more details on building the renderers, see:
- [Web Core README](../../../../renderers/web_core/README.md)
- [Lit Renderer README](../../../../renderers/lit/README.md)

## Getting Started

1.  **Navigate to this directory**:
    ```bash
    cd samples/client/lit/local_gallery
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command will:
    - Sync all JSON examples from `specification/v0_8/json/catalogs/minimal/examples/`.
    - Generate a manifest file (`index.json`) for dynamic discovery.
    - Start the Vite server at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Architecture

- **Agentless**: Unlike other samples, this does not require a running Python agent. It simulates agent responses locally for interactive components (like the Login Form).
- **Dynamic Loading**: The app automatically discovers and loads *all* `.json` files present in the v0.8 minimal specification folder at build time. To add a new test case, simply drop a JSON file into that specification folder and restart the dev server.
- **Surface Isolation**: Each example is rendered into its own independent `a2ui-surface` with a unique ID derived from the filename.
- **Mock Agent Console**: All user interactions (button clicks, form submissions) are intercepted and logged to a sidebar, demonstrating how the renderer resolves actions and contexts.
